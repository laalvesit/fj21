                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch.100711
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)
  +1: kkolinko: +1 for the updated patch (maven.patch.100711)
      I still think that it is not so good to remove the old code of <remoteRepository/>,
      because it ignores ${maven.repo.url} parameter provided by deploy-snapshot,
      deploy-staging and deploy-release targets. Maybe leave old code as a comment
      and fix it later if needed? I think that actually nobody besides the release manager
      uses this, so I am letting this pass.

* Add StuckThreadDetectionValve
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b
  +1: slaurent
  +1: kkolinko: several comments are below
  -1:
  kkolinko: To view/download this as a patch file you add ".diff" to the URL above. That is:
  https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/tomcat60/commit/252334f958877221ecb2dc64ee0fd12bb77e360b.diff

  kkolinko: Minor glitches:
    - In mbeans-descriptors.xml:
      - There are no properties "asyncSupported", "stateName" in TC6 version of this valve.
    - In valve.xml:
      - s/tomcat log/Tomcat log/ (or Apache Tomcat log)
    - In StuckThreadDetectionValve.java:
      - private classes CompletedStuckThread, MonitoredThread: make them static (r1175897)
      - Use Long.valueOf() and explicit boxing/unboxing (r1138132, r1175897)
      - getStuckThreadIds() returns a list of ids. It might be useful to
        have a similar method that returns Thread.getName() names.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50570
  Apply FIPS mode patch from TC7:
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1199985&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1200004&view=rev
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1200448&view=rev
  +1: schultz, jfclere
  -1: kkolinko: It needs to include more preceding and followup
   changes. Updated patch proposed below.

* Backport AprLifecycleListener improvements from TC7
  This includes:
   - Use consistent external synchronization object for private
     initialization methods. Turn initialization flags to false after APR
     has been terminated. That is, to terminate it only once.
     (rev. 946671 + several after it)
   - Use ExceptionUtils.handleThrowable() for fatal errors
     (rev. 1001904)
   - Do not allow to change SSL options if SSL engine has already been
     initialised.
     (rev. 1199985 + several after it)
   - Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50570
     Enable FIPS mode to be set in AprLifecycleListener.
     Based upon a patch from Chris Beckey.
     (rev. 1199985 + several after it)
  kkolinko: I tested only that it does not break things with the current
    released tcnative version 1.1.22 that does not have FIPS mode support.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-11-12_tc6_AprLifecycleListener.patch

* Fix autodeployment of applications that have configuration errors.
  If autodeployment fails, create DeployedApplication object and register
  what we deployed (xml or war or dir - a single file) as redeployResource.
  If it is updated the application will be redeployed.
  + ContainerBase patch adds display of failed apps in manager. They can be
  listed and undeployed.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-11-14_tc6_HostConfig.patch
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-11-14_tc6_ContainerBase.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* Add denyStatus attribute to RequestFilterValve
  (RemoteAddrValve, RemoteHostValve valves). It allows to use different
  HTTP response code when rejecting denied request. E.g. 404 instead of 403.
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-11-16_tc6_RequestFilterValve_denyStatus.patch
  (r1202565 in trunk, r1202570 in TC7)
  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* Reduce overhead from exception handling in UDecoder
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2011-11-17_tc6_UDecoder.patch
  (r1203054 in TC7)
  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* Align %2f handling between implementations of UDecoder.convert()
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1203091&view=rev
  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52225
  Fix ClassCastException in Alias added for existing host via JMX
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1204856&view=rev
  (without tests; it is r1204860 in TC7)
  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* Do not throw IllegalArgumentException from parseParameters() call when
  chunked POST request is too large, but treat it like an IO error.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1206200&view=rev
  (without tests; it is r1206205 in TC7)

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

* Backport JSP unloading patch (BZ48358).
  The patch has substantially changed since the original version.
  Original revisions are: 937787, 1028377, 1028389, 1028396, 1028861, 1028862, 1028863,
  1028935, 1028939, 1028940, 1028944, 1028950, 1030014, 1030037
  Combined TC 6 patch:
  http://people.apache.org/~rjung/patches/BZ48358-JSP_Unloading-TC6_20101118.patch
  +1: rjung
  -0: markt - http://markmail.org/thread/777be426ulcfmdd3 suggests there may be
              a memory leak in this code somewhere. I'd like to get to the
              bottom of that before porting this
      rjung:  I started a discussion about JSPs and memory on the dev list.
              The updated patch fixes a race condition.
              We can stall this item until we get some feedback about 7.0.5.
      markt - r1172614 needs to be included in this proposal. With that patch,
              my testing shows that the unloading works as designed
